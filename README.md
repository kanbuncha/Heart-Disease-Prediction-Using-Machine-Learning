# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
“Disease Prediction” system based on predictive modeling predicts the disease of the user on the basis of the symptoms that user provides as an input to the system. The system analyzes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the probability of the disease as an output. Disease Prediction is done by implementing 7 techniques such as Naïve Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, SVM, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest Algorithms. These techniques calculate the probability of the disease. Therefore, maximum prediction accuracy probability 91.80% is obtained.
